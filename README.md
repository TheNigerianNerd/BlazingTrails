# 🏞️ BlazingTrails

**BlazingTrails** is an app built in Blazor using C#12 and .NET8 while reading *Blazor in Action* — a hands-on guide to mastering component-based web development with **.NET** and **C#** by Chris Saintly.  
This project demonstrates practical skills across the entire Blazor stack — from UI components and routing to authentication, state management, and testing.

---

## 🚀 Overview

BlazingTrails is a **single-page application (SPA)** for discovering and sharing hiking trails.  
Developed incrementally through 11 chapters of *Blazor in Action*, it serves as both:
- A **learning tool** for developers exploring Blazor, and  
- A **portfolio project** that showcases modern .NET web practices.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This app covers the key concepts every Blazor developer should master:

| Area | Concepts & Features |
|------|----------------------|
| **UI Components** | Reusable Razor components, parent-child communication, lifecycle methods |
| **Routing** | Client-side navigation, route parameters, and programmatic redirects |
| **Forms & Validation** | Built-in form components, custom form inputs, validation messages |
| **Templated Components** | Generic, reusable templates for flexible UI layouts |
| **JavaScript Interop** | Calling JS from C# and vice versa to extend functionality |
| **Authentication** | Secure login using **Auth0** (OAuth2 / OIDC) |
| **State Management** | In-memory state container and LocalStorage persistence |
| **Testing** | Component testing using **bUnit** for markup, events, and interop |
